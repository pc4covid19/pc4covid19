<h2 id="about"><strong>COVID19 tissue simulator</strong></h2>
<p>This model simulates replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus / COVID19) in a layer of epithelium. 
It is being rapidly prototyped and refined with community support (<a href="#model_details">see below</a>). </p>

<p>In this model, SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus / COVID19) infects a single cell. The virus is uncoated to expose viral RNA, which synthesizes viral proteins that are assembled into a virion. Assembled virions are exported to the environment. Virions diffuse and can infect other cells (including the original cell). </p>

<p>The model includes a basic pharmacodynamic response (to assembled virions) to cause cell apoptosis. Apoptosed cells release some or all of their internal contents, notably including virions. </p> 

<p><strong>Legend:</strong></b>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circles:</strong> These are lung epithelial cells. They are colored by their (assembled) virion loads in four colors

<ul style="font-family: courier;">
<li><span style="font-weight: strong; background-color: rgb(0,0,255)"    >dark blue----:</span> Cells with 0 assembled virions. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: strong; background-color: rgb(64,64,199)"  >pale blue----:</span> Cells with 1-9 assembled virions. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: strong; background-color: rgb(128,128,128)">grey---------:</span> Cells with 10-99 assembled virions. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: strong; background-color: rgb(199,199,64)" >light yellow-:</span> Cells with 100-999 assembled virions. </li>
<li><span style="font-weight: strong; background-color: rgb(255,255,0)"  >bright yellow:</span> Cells with 1000+ assembled virions. </li>

</ul>
Black cells are apoptotic (dead from viral load).

<h2 id="GUI_overview"><strong>GUI Overview</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Config Basics</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  input parameters common to all models (e.g., domain grid, simulation time, choice/frequency of outputs)</li>
<li><b>Microenvironment</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp; microenvironment parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>User Params</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>Out: Plots</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output display of cells and substrates</li>
</ul>
Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress of the simulation. When the simulation generates output files,
they can be visualized in the "Out: Plots" tab. The "# cell frames" will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.

<p>This model and cloud-hosted demo are part of the education 
    and outreach for the IU Engineered nanoBIO Node and the NCI-funded cancer systems biology grant U01CA232137. 
    The models are built using <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991" target="_blank">PhysiCell</a>: 
    a C++ framework for multicellular systems biology.</p>


<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Basic instructions</a></h2>

<p>Modify parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot;, &quot;Microenvironment&quot;, or &quot;User Params&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the output results, click the &quot;Out: Plots&quot; tab, and move the slider bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;# cell frames&quot; field will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>If there are multiple substrates defined in the Microenvironment, you can select a different one from the drop-down widget in the Plots tab. You can also fix the colormap range of values.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
