attachment notes:

the following functions automatically detach cells:

delete_cell
ingest_cell (on target cell)
lyse_cell 

divide 


// copy, assignment ? 


evaluated once every dt_mechanics in 

PhysiCell_container.cpp
using: 
void evaluate_interactions( Cell*, Phenotype& , double ); 


contact functions: 
void f( Cell* pC1, Phenotype& p1, Cell* pC2, Phenotype& p2 , double dt );

C1 is the cell, and C2 is the cell it's interacting with. 
Don't forget that C2 will also execute this function. 
Best practice: If C1 <--> C2, read/write C2, adn write C1. The other half of hte interaction comes from teh call by C2.
Best practice: If C1 --> C2 (C1 acts on C2, but C2 does not act on C1), let C1 peform the action, but use an OMP critical (if the function is not thread safe).
