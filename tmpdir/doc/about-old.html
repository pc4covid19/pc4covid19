<h2 id="about"><strong>COVID19 tissue simulator</strong></h2>
<p>This model simulates replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus / COVID19) in a layer of epithelium. 
It is being rapidly prototyped and refined with community support (<a href="#model_details">see below</a>). </p>

<p>In this model, SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus / COVID19) infects a single cell, or a 
    solution of virions is administered to the extracellular space. The virus is 
    uncoated to explose viral RNA, which synthesizes viral proteins that are 
    assembled into a virion. Assembled virions are exported to the environment, 
    where they can diffuse and infect other cells. In the extracellular space, 
    virions adhere to ACE2 receptors and get internalized through endocytosis. 
    Internalized ACE2 receptors release their virus cargo and are recycled back to the surface.
</p>
<p>
The model includes a basic pharmacodynamic response (to assembled virions) to cause 
    cell apoptosis. Apoptosed cells release some or all of their internal contents, 
    notably including virions.

<h3 style="color: red; font-weight: strong">Caveats and disclaimers</h3>
<strong>This model is under active development using rapid prototyping:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It has not been peer reviewed. </li>
<li>It is intended to drive basic scientific research and public education at this stage.</li>
<li><strong>It cannot be used for public policy decisions. </strong></li>
<li><strong>It cannot be used for individual medical decisions.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>
This model will be continually refined with input from the community, particularly experts 
    in infectious diseases. The validation state will be updated as this progresses.</strong></p>

<li><b>Config Basics</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  input parameters common to all models (e.g., domain grid, simulation time, choice/frequency of outputs)</li>
<li><b>Microenvironment</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp; microenvironment parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>User Params</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user parameters that are model-specific</li>

</ul>
Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress of the simulation. When the simulation generates output files,
they can be visualized in the "Out: Plots" tab. The "# cell frames" will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.

<p>This model and cloud-hosted demo are part of the education 
    and outreach for the IU Engineered nanoBIO Node and the NCI-funded cancer systems biology grant U01CA232137. 
    The models are built using <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991" target="_blank">PhysiCell</a>: 
    a C++ framework for multicellular systems biology.</p>


<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Basic instructions</a></h2>

<p>Modify parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot;, &quot;Microenvironment&quot;, &quot;User Params&quot;, or &quot;Cell Types&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the output results, click the &quot;Out: Plots&quot; tab, and move the slider bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;# cell frames&quot; field will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>If there are multiple substrates defined in the Microenvironment, you can select a different one from the drop-down widget in the Plots tab. You can also fix the colormap range of values.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice. And you can also generate an animation of the cells to play in the browser and, optionally, download as a video.</p>
