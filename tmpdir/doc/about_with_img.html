<h2 id="about"><strong>COVID19 tissue simulator</strong></h2>
<p>This model simulates viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus / COVID19) in a layer of epithelium and an immune response. 
It is being rapidly prototyped and refined with community support (<a href="#model_details">see below</a>). </p>

<p>
This multiscale simulator combines several modules:
<ul>
<li><b>Tissue:</b> Virus, cell debris, and chemokines diffuse within the extracellular space. They may also “decay” to reflect removal by interstitial flow into nearby blood vessels or airways.</li>
    
<br>
<li><b>ACE2:</b> receptor dynamics: Virions bind to ACE2 receptors on the surface, which are internalized (endocytosed) into cells. After virions are released from internalized receptors, they can return to the surface.</li>

<br>
<li><b>Viral replication:</b> Internalized virus is uncoated to expose viral RNA, which synthesizes viral proteins that are assembled into virions. Assembled virions are transported to the cell surface to be exported to the tissue (exocytosed).</li>
    
<br>
<li><b>Single-cell</b> response: Infected cells secrete a chemokine that may attract immune cells. In a simple pharmacodynamics response (to assembled virions), infected cells can undergo apoptosis. Apoptosed cells release some or all of their internal contents, notably including virions.</li>

<br>
<li><b>Immune response (new in v3):</b></li>
<ul>
<br>
    <li><b>Resident (and recruited) macrophages</b> seek apoptotic cells. They phagocytose (ingest) dead cells upon contact and activate.</li>
    
<br>
    <li><b>Activated macrophages</b> release a pro-inflammatory cytokine to recruit other immune cells, while seeking both apoptotic and infected cells by chemotaxis. Activated macrophages can “wear out” and apoptose after phagocytosing too much material.</li>
    
<br>
    <li><b>Neutrophils</b> are recruited by accumulated pro-inflammatory cytokine. They seek apoptotic cells, phagocytose them, and activate. Activated neutrophils seek both apoptotic and infected cells. Neutrophils also capture extracellular virions.</li>
    
<br>
    <li><b>CD8 T cells</b> are recruited by accumulated pro-inflammatory cytokine. They seek and adhere to infected cells. After sufficient contact time with one or more CD8 T cells, infected cells undergo apoptosis.</li>
</ul> 
</ul>

<strong>This model is under active development using rapid prototyping:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It has not been peer reviewed. </li>
<li>It is intended to drive basic scientific research and public education at this stage.</li>
<li><strong>It cannot be used for public policy decisions. </strong></li>
<li><strong>It cannot be used for individual medical decisions.</strong></li>
</ul> -->

<p><strong>
This model will be continually refined with input from the community, particularly experts 
in infectious diseases. The validation state will be updated as this progresses.</strong></p>

<p>
Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress of the simulation. When the simulation generates output files,
they can be visualized in the "Out: Plots" tab. The "# cell frames" will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.
